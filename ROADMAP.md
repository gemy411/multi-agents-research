# Research Agents Development Roadmap

This project aims to build a sophisticated multi-agent research system with advanced capabilities for information retrieval, analysis, and collaboration. The development is organized into strategic milestones outlined below.

## Core Functionality Milestones

- [x] **Develop Functional Research Agents**: Create the foundational agent architecture with basic research capabilities, query processing, and information synthesis.
- [ ] **True thinking during waiting times**: While the subagents are working, the researcher can think about the previous
results and how it can utilize the given information to proceed with further research
- [ ] **Optimize Parallel Processing**: Implement efficient parallelism through time-travel mechanisms and progress monitoring to maximize computational resources.
- [ ] **Enhance Memory Management**: Optimize how agents store, retrieve, and utilize information to improve performance and reduce resource consumption.
- [ ] **Implement Citation System**: Develop a robust citation framework to track information sources and ensure research credibility and traceability.

## Architectural Improvements

- [ ] **Refine Architectural Structure**: Reorganize components into appropriate architectural layers to improve maintainability, scalability, and adherence to design principles.
- [X] **Create a simple HTTP API**: Create an HTTP API to enable external applications to interact with the multi-agent research system.
- [ ] **Develop HTTP API Integration**: Create a comprehensive HTTP API to enable external applications to interact with the multi-agent research system. Like choosing different operation modes that can result in different models and operation duration
- [X] **Implement MCP Server Capabilities**: Deploy research capabilities as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to standardize interactions with various AI models.

## Future Enhancements

Additional milestones will be defined as the project evolves, focusing on expanding capabilities, improving user experience, and integrating with other systems.
